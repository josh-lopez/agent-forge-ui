# agent-forge-ui — product spec

The demonstration web UI built by agent-forge. Read by the BA agent to ground
backlog work in the product's purpose.

## Mission

A small, self-contained web application that serves as a live demonstration of
agentic engineering: humans file issues describing features, and the agent-forge
pipeline designs, builds, tests, and ships them as merge-ready PRs.

## What success looks like

- A working, deployable front-end with a clear, simple structure.
- Each shipped change is small, tested, and reviewable.
- Standard project hygiene (README, licence, sensible build config).

## Non-goals

- No backend services in this repo (agent-forge's control plane is separate).
- No production data or secrets.
